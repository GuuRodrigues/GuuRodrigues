### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Augusto Rodrigues, and I'm a front-end developer passionate about creating incredible interfaces. Specializing in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I transform designs into functional and responsive code. I believe that user experience is fundamental, and I am always looking for creative solutions to make the web more beautiful and accessible.
